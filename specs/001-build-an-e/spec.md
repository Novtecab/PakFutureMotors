   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A car enthusiast visits PakFutureMotors to browse and purchase cars, car accessories, and book automotive services. They can browse products by category, add items to their shopping cart, book services like ceramic coating, and complete purchases through an integrated payment gateway.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is browsing the product catalog, **When** they select a car or accessory, **Then** they can view detailed product information, pricing, and availability
2. **Given** a user has items in their shopping cart, **When** they proceed to checkout, **Then** they can complete payment through the integrated payment gateway
3. **Given** a user wants to book a service, **When** they select a service like ceramic coating, **Then** they can choose appointment slots and complete the booking with payment
4. **Given** a user has completed a purchase, **When** the transaction is processed, **Then** they receive confirmation and order tracking information
5. **Given** a guest user is shopping, **When** they want to complete a purchase, **Then** they can either checkout as guest or create an account

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a car or accessory goes out of stock during checkout?
- How does the system handle payment failures or timeouts?
- What occurs when a service booking slot becomes unavailable during booking process?
- How are booking conflicts handled for service appointments?
- What happens when a user abandons their cart and returns later?
