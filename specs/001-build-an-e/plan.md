# Implementation Plan: E-Commerce Platform for Cars and Services

**Branch**: `001-build-an-e` | **Date**: 2024-12-19 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/workspaces/PakFutureMotors/specs/001-build-an-e/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code, or `AGENTS.md` for all other agents).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
E-commerce platform for PakFutureMotors featuring car and accessory sales with integrated service booking system. Supports multi-method authentication, comprehensive payment processing (cards, digital wallets, bank transfers), fixed hourly service scheduling, and full administrative management. Technical approach: modern web application with separate frontend/backend architecture, secure payment gateway integration, and robust booking management system.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: JavaScript/TypeScript (Node.js 18+, React 18+)  
**Primary Dependencies**: Express.js/FastAPI, React, PostgreSQL, Redis, Stripe/PayPal APIs  
**Storage**: PostgreSQL for relational data, Redis for sessions/caching, file storage for product images  
**Testing**: Jest/Vitest for frontend, pytest/Jest for backend, Cypress for E2E  
**Target Platform**: Web application (responsive design), Linux server deployment
**Project Type**: web (frontend + backend + database)  
**Performance Goals**: <2s page load, <500ms API response, 1000+ concurrent users  
**Constraints**: PCI DSS compliance for payments, GDPR compliance for data, 99.9% uptime  
**Scale/Scope**: 10k+ products, 100k+ users, multi-tenant service booking system

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Status**: ✅ PASS - No constitutional violations detected

**Evaluation**:
- Security-first approach: PCI DSS compliance planned for payment processing
- Scalable architecture: Microservices-ready design with separate frontend/backend
- Maintainable codebase: TypeScript for type safety, comprehensive testing strategy
- User-focused design: Multi-auth options, responsive UI, comprehensive admin tools

**Complexity Justification**: E-commerce with service booking requires sophisticated payment integration, booking algorithms, and multi-role user management - complexity is warranted by business requirements.

```

**Structure Decision**: Selected web application structure with separate frontend and backend directories. The project follows a modern full-stack TypeScript architecture with:
- `backend/` - Express.js API with TypeScript, Prisma ORM, Redis caching
- `frontend/` - React SPA with TypeScript, Redux Toolkit state management
- `shared/` - Common types and utilities
- `docs/` - Documentation and guides
- `infrastructure/` - DevOps and deployment configurations

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: ✅ research.md with all technical decisions documented

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh copilot`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: ✅ data-model.md, contracts/ directory, quickstart.md, .github/copilot-instructions.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*No constitutional violations identified - justified complexity for business requirements*

**Complexity Justifications**:
- **Multi-payment integration**: Required for customer choice and business expansion (cards + digital wallets + bank transfers)
- **Dual-mode system**: Product sales + service booking serve distinct business models requiring different data flows
- **Multi-auth providers**: Maximizes user conversion with email, social, and phone options
- **Comprehensive admin system**: Full analytics and management capabilities needed for business operations

All complexity serves clear business requirements and cannot be simplified without reducing core functionality.
